# Workshop #1 Repository

First, I would like to thank everyone for attending our workshop. I hope it provided a solid foundation for understanding the core concepts behind machine learning. 

Understanding the building blocks we discussed in the first session will make future encounters with ML concepts much easier to grasp. So, I encourage you all to revisit the content we explored, and feel free to dive deeper into more ideas!

## Jupyter Notebook

You can either set up Jupyter Notebook locally or use Google Colab online during the practice sessions (installing locally allows you to better utilize your computer's resources).

If you wish to install locally, you'll need to install and set up the following:

- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com)
- [Python (latest version)](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

To simplify the environment setup using Anaconda, follow this helpful video: [Anaconda Setup Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h1sAzPojKMg)

## Recommended Books

- **The Elements of Statistical Learning** (by Jerome H. Friedman, Robert Tibshirani, and Trevor Hastie)  
  This book delves into the theoretical aspects of machine learning. It’s great as a reference book for those interested in the finer details of algorithms.

- **Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn and TensorFlow** (by Aurelien Geron)  
  A perfect blend of theory and practical coding exercises. This book includes assignments that allow you to test your understanding of the concepts.

I'll recommend more books as we delve into advanced topics!
